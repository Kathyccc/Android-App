## Project Topics: Mobile to Cloud application

##Overview
This project is a comprehensive exploration of building a distributed application that bridges mobile and cloud environments. The application is centered around a native Android app that interacts with a cloud-based RESTful web service. The goal is to create a seamless experience where mobile users can fetch and process data from a third-party API, with the backend logic handled by the cloud service.

##Key Features
- Third-Party API Integration: The application fetches data from a reliable third-party API, processes it on the server side, and delivers relevant information to the mobile client.

- Cloud-Hosted Web Service: A RESTful web service deployed to the cloud manages business logic, interacts with the third-party API, and ensures data integrity.

- Data Persistence with MongoDB Atlas: The application uses MongoDB Atlas for storing and retrieving data, providing a scalable and flexible database solution in the cloud.

- Native Android Application: The mobile app features a user-friendly interface, with multiple view components, that interacts with the cloud service to provide real-time data and responses to user inputs.

- Operations Dashboard: A web-based dashboard offers insights into application usage, including logging and analytics, all powered by the data stored in MongoDB.

This project demonstrates the feasibility of integrating third-party APIs, cloud-based web services, and native mobile applications into a cohesive and functional distributed system. Through this, it showcases practical skills in cloud deployment, API management, and mobile development.
